# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection Web App

This project is a deep learning-powered web application that detects pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It leverages a pre-trained VGG16 model with transfer learning and is deployed using Flask and Docker.

## 🌐 Live Demo

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User uploads a chest X-ray image.
2. Image is preprocessed using VGG16-style input.
3. The model predicts whether the person is infected with pneumonia or safe.
4. Prediction is displayed in the browser.

## 🧠 Model Details

- Base Model: **VGG16** (pretrained on ImageNet)
- Custom layers: Flatten + Dense (Softmax for binary classification)
- Dataset: Kaggle Chest X-ray Pneumonia dataset
- Data Augmentation: Zoom, shear, horizontal flip, rescaling
- Training Epochs: 5 (can be increased for better accuracy)

## 🐳 Deployment

### Using Docker

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t pneumonia-app .

# Run container
docker run -p 8000:8000 pneumonia-app
```

### Using Render

- Create a new Web Service
- Use the Docker deployment method
- Expose port `8000`
- Use `web: gunicorn app:app` in the `render.yaml` or start command

## 📸 Sample UI

User-friendly interface to upload images and view results.

## 🧪 To Train Your Own Model

```bash
python pneumonia.py
```
